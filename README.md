Movie Recommendation System - Getting top 5 movies recommended 

In this kernel we'll be building a baseline Movie Recommendation System using TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset. For novices like me this kernel will pretty much serve as a foundation in recommendation systems and will provide you with something to start with

Content Based Filtering- 

They suggest similar items based on a particular item. This system uses item metadata, such as genre, director, description, actors, etc. for movies, to make these recommendations. The general idea behind these recommender systems is that if a person liked a particular item, he or she will also like an item that is similar to it.
